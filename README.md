# Expense tracker
I like to keep a close eye on my finances, so I created this spreadsheet to provide an up-to-date and easily accessible overview of my budget.
### Data
The spreadsheet includes a worksheet with a table for storing new transactions. Sample data is provided to illustrate the project.

### Dashboard
Since this tracker was created for personal use, I tailored it to my specific needs. The dashboard provides information on:
- total balance, income, and expenses, accompanied by a pie chart illustrating the percentage breakdown between income and spending
- savings rate
- spending by category over different months
- monthly spending breakdown by category. 

### Tools
Key Excel features utilized:
- Pivot tables
- Pivot charts with slicers
- Multiple dependent drop-down lists
- Macro for adding new transactions and refreshing data
- VBA code incorporating a date picker (sourced from an online tutorial)
