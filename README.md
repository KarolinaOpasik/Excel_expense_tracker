# Expense tracker
I wanted to practice my Excel skills in a practical way. Since I like to keep a close eye on my finances, I decided to create this [expense tracker](https://1drv.ms/x/c/a5f37b09cdf968da/EQ_2exIIDkxGq0l32WNySDUBFQAvK6LYHzDmGi9rmrLq4g?e=8KZHYB) which provides me an up-to-date and easily accessible overview of my budget.

### Data
The spreadsheet includes a worksheet with a table for storing new transactions. Sample data is provided to illustrate the project.

### Dashboard
Since this tracker was created for personal use, I tailored it to my specific needs. The dashboard provides information on:
- Total balance, income, and expenses, accompanied by a pie chart illustrating the percentage breakdown between income and spending
- Savings rate
- Spending by category over different months
- Monthly spending breakdown by category

Key Excel features utilized:
- Pivot tables
